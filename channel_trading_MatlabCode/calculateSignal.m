%Code to generate our boolean trading signals simply based on breakouts.
%I.e. these signals only used if position=0

function [signal] = calculateSignal(t, max, min, high, low)
%Will return a vector consisting of 1s, 0s, and -1s.
%1 corresponds to the next bar's high being greater than the trailing max.
%-1 corresponds to the next bar's low being less than the trailing min.
%0 indicates neither option.

%Initialize our signal vector
