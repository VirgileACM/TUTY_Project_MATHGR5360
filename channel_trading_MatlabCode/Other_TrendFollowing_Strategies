More trend following strategies. Perhaps we could just mention it in the presentation on a slide or two like how the last presentation did?

-Moving Average crossover.
    -Define two moving averages: one short-term and one long-term
    -When the short-term crosses above the long-term, go long.
    -When the short-term crosses below the long-term, go flat (or go short).
    
-Types of moving averages
    -Simple
        -Simple mean of the price of the past X number of days.
    -Weigthed
        -Weighted average by placing more weight on the more recent prices.
    -Exponential
        -A type of weighted moving average.
        -For a price that occured i days ago, the weight would be a^i. With 0<a<1
        
-MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
    -Another popular signal is the MACD.
    -Define the MACD as the difference between two exponential moving averages (for example say 12-day and 26-day)
        -MACD = 12day EMA - 26day EMA
    -Take an EMA of the MACD as your signal.
        -When the signal turns positive, go long.
        -When the signal turns negative, go flat (or go short)
